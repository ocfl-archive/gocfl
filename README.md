# Go OCFL Implementation

This library supports the Oxford Common Filesystem Layout ([OCFL](https://ocfl.io/)) 
and focuses on creation, update, validation and extraction of ocfl StorageRoots and Objects.

GOCFL command line tool supports the following subcommands
* [init](docs/init.md)
* [add](docs/add.md)
* [create](docs/create.md)
* [update](docs/update.md)
* [validate](docs/validate.md)
* [info](docs/stat.md)
* [extract](docs/extract.md)
* [extractmeta](docs/extractmeta.md)
* [display](docs/display.md)

There's a [quickstart guide](docs/quickstart.md) available.

## Why
There are several [OCFL tools & libraries](https://github.com/OCFL/spec/wiki/Implementations#code-libraries-validators-and-other-tools) 
which already exists. This software is build with the following motivation.

### I/O Performance
Regarding performance, Storage I/O generates the main performance issues. Therefor, every file 
should be read and written only once. Only in case of deduplication, the checksum of a file is
calculated before ingest and a second time while ingesting. 

### Container 
Serialization of an OCFL Storage Root into a container format like ZIP must not generate 
overhead on disk I/O. Therefor generation of an OCFL Container is possible without an intermediary
OCFL Storage Root on a filesystem.  

#### Encryption 
For storing OCFL containers in low-security locations (cloud storage, etc.), it's possible to 
create an AES-256 encrypted container on ingest.

### Extensions
The extensions described in the OCFL standard are quite open in their functionality and may 
belong to the [Storage Root](https://ocfl.io/1.1/spec/#storage-root-extensions) or
[Object](https://ocfl.io/1.1/spec/#object-extensions). Since there's no specification of a 
generic extension api, it's difficult to integrate specific extension hooks into other libraries. 
This library identifies 7 different extension hooks so far.

#### Indexer
When content is ingested into OCFL objects, technical metadata should be extracted and stored alongside the manifest data. This allows technical metadata to be extracted alongside the content.
Since the OCFL structure is quite rigid, there's a need for a special extension to support this.
